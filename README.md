# WCFS-Feature-selection-for-classify-the-tumor
the Feature Selection method based on correlation with iterative Bayesian multivariate technique is designed for tumor detection. It is employed to choose the subsets of medical features pertinent for categorizing brain tumors. The Iterative Bayesian Multivariate Deep Neural Network classifies the medical data into normal or abnormal. Bayesian Multivariate Linear Regression (BMLR) and Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) in a hidden layer of deep neural network help improve the accuracy of tumor detection.
